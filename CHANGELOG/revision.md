- Update `quasar` to `scala` `2.11.8`
- Update `sbt-buildinfo` to `0.6.1` so that generated build information code compiles under our compiler flags
- Make pattern match total which would have caused an exception to be thrown on certain types of queries
- create `join` folder for regression tests that assert behavior over joins
- add regression test for join where constant is on the left side (would previously cause a pattern match error)
- add regression test for join where the join condition is not a simple comparison (would previously cause a pattern match error)
- Add filename to output error when failing to parse json regression test file
