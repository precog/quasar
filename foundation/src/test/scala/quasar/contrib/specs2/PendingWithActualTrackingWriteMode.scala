 * Specs2 trait helper that can be used to *write* new actuals that are usually
 * *read* and tested with `PendingWithActualTracking`. This trait is designed
 * to make writing these new actuals as easy as possible: all you have to do is
 * mix in this trait instead of `PendingWithActualTracking` and the test will
 * run all `pendingWithActual` specs in write mode instead.
 *
 * Note: Style of this code is adopted from specs2 (PendingUntilFixed.scala).
