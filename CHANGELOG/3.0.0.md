- Switched over to use [semver](http://semver.org/) to version Quasar
- New internal architecture (does not change any external API)
  - Switch over to use pathy Path instead of Quasar's own path abstraction (except in `LogicalPlan`)
  - Make use of the Free Monad to model effectful APIs
- More flexibility defining Query expressions in SQL dialect
  - Can use expressions that don’t begin with select as standalone queries, e.g. `5 + 1`
  - Added the `^` (power) operator and literal map syntax to SQL²: `{4: "four", 3: "three"}`
